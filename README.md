# Picture Hunter API (2024)

An experimental multimodal API backend for generating real-time monsters from user-submitted images.  
Used in the interactive entertainment system **Picture Hunter II**, presented at EC2024.

## Overview

**Picture Hunter API** is the backend component of the game *Picture Hunter II*, a real-time, multiplayer, photo-based strategy game.  
It transforms images submitted by players into monster attributes through a pipeline involving:

- Image Captioning via GPT-4o
- Text Embedding with OpenAI `text-embedding-3`
- Semantic mapping to in-game stats (HP, ATK, SPEED, DPS)
- Real-time storage and syncing via Firestore

This API enables the connection between the physical world and the digital battlefield.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Player-oriented input**: Players submit real-world photos to influence in-game outcomes.
- **Balanced mapping**: Combines *predictability* and *surprise* to maintain engagement.
- **Multimodal AI**: Leverages strengths and weaknesses of LLMs (e.g., hallucinations) as gameplay elements.

## System Architecture

```text
Player Image
   │
   ├─▶ GPT-4o (Caption Generation)
   │
   ├─▶ Embedding (OpenAI Text-Embedding-3)
   │
   ├─▶ Vector Mapping → Game Stats (HP, ATK, DPS...)
   │
   └─▶ Store to Firebase Firestore

---

## Tech Stack

- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o
- **Embedding Model**: `text-embedding-3` (OpenAI)
- **Storage / Sync**: Firebase Firestore
- **Framework**: Python (Flask or FastAPI recommended)
- **Deployment**: Cloud Functions (GCP), or your own server

## Example API Usage (pseudo-code)

```bash
POST /generate-monster

{
  "image_base64": "...",
  "team_id": "kanto"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "name": "Flame Basilisk",
  "caption": "A fiery lizard coiled in red smoke",
  "stats": {
    "hp": 1200,
    "atk": 300,
    "speed": 1.6,
    "dps": 250
  }
}
```

## Future Plans

- Add monster evolution logic & leveling system
- Improve numeric stability in LLM outputs
- Integrate text-to-image (e.g., DALL·E) for visuals
- Add embedding-based clustering for monster types
